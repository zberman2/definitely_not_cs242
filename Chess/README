This is the project README file. This projects describes the
functionality of a game of Chess.  Currently, a basic game loop is
implemented in the Main class, but it is mostly for debugging purposes.

Ideas for refactoring:
    To speed up the program, brainstorm ideas for refactoring the
    ArrayList of Pieces (hash table, 2d array, etc)

TODO: Refactor and Polish Test Suit
    add more cases for check/checkmate/stalemate in Master
    make test cases more modular (one assert per test)
