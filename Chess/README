This is the project README file. This projects describes the
functionality of a game of Chess.  Currently, a basic game loop is
implemented in the Main class, but it is mostly for debugging purposes.

Ideas for refactoring: The methods in the Piece class for determining
    valid horizontal/vertical/diagonal motion should be in the Board
    class to maintain the hierarchy of the classes which goes
    Master -> Board -> Piece
